// caveman — optional Claude Code SessionStart activation hook
//
// When wired into ~/.claude/settings.json as a SessionStart hook:
//   - Writes a flag file at ~/.claude/.caveman-active so a statusline
//     script can prove caveman mode is loaded (see README for the badge
//     snippet — SessionStart stdout is otherwise invisible to users)
//   - Emits a short ruleset reminder as SessionStart context
//
// This is a pure addition — if you don't wire it up, nothing changes.
// Install instructions: see the "Optional: SessionStart Hook" section
// in README.md.
